Evening Doc
It
s nine o
clock on a Wednesday


The regular crowd shuffles in


There
s an old man lying next to me


Spewing vomit all over his chin
He says, 
Doc, can you give me a medicine?


The name ought to be on my chart


But it
s safe and it
s strong


And it helped me along


When I had a younger man
s heart
♪ ♬ La la la, de de da, la la la de da, da dum ♪ ♬
Give us some drugs, you
re the evening doc


Give us some drugs tonight


Well we
re all in the mood for some opiates


And they
ll get us feeling alright
Now John in bed five is a friend of mine


He gets bouts of COPD


And he
s quick with a joke or to light up a smoke


Which I guess is what brings him to me
He says, 
Doc, I believe this is killing me


I agree he is probably right


And he tells me that
s it, and he swears that he
ll quit


And he asks me to pass him a light
♪ ♬ La la la, de de da, la la la de da, da dum ♪ ♬
Now Paul is a boy with leukaemia


Who never had time for a wife


And he
s talking with Meg, who takes food through a PEG


And will probably have to for life
And the man in bed ten yells obscenities


As the lady in six gives a moan


She
s paying eight thousand for hospice care


But it
s better than dying alone
Give us some drugs, you
re the evening doc


Give us some drugs tonight


Well we
re all in the mood for some opiates


And they
ll get us feeling alright
It
s a pretty good crowd for a Wednesday


And the pharmacist gives me a vial


Cause he knows that it
s that, they
ve been coming to get


To forget about pain for a while
And the corridor smells like c. difficile


And the bed alarm sounds like a jeer


And I take some caffeine and I stare at my screen


And think 
God, what am I doing here?
Give us some drugs, you
re the evening doc


Give us some drugs tonight


Well we
re all in the mood for some opiates


And they
ll get us feeling alright
